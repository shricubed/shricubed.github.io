Hey! I'm Shrikar Vasisht, a senior CS and math major at the University of Maryland. My interests include cybersecurity, puzzles, and more recently, photography. I'm planning to make this page my portfolio, and also include a blog about cybersecurity.

I'm currently an intern at Cisco in summer 2023, working on security engineering projects. I'm experienced with multiple coding languages including Python, Java, Rust, and SQL. I've previously worked at Leidos and with multiple professors at UMD. As a double major with math, I aim to apply both fields to solve complex problems in security and related areas.
