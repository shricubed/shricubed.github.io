Hey! I'm Shrikar Vasisht, a senior CS and math major at the University of Maryland. My interests and hobbies include cybersecurity, puzzles, reading scifi and thriller novels, and photography.

I'm currently an intern at Cisco for summer 2023, working on security engineering projects. I'm experienced with multiple coding languages including Python, Java, Rust, and SQL. I've previously worked at Leidos and with multiple professors at UMD. As a double major with math, I aim to apply both fields to solve complex problems in security and related areas.
