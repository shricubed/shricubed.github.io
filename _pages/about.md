Hey! I'm **Shrikar Vasisht**, a senior CS and math major at the **University of Maryland**. My interests and hobbies include cybersecurity, puzzles, reading scifi and thriller novels, and photography.

I'm currently an intern at **Cisco** for summer 2023, working on security engineering projects. I'm experienced with multiple coding languages including **Python, Java, Rust**, and **C/C++**. I've previously worked at **Leidos** and with multiple professors at UMD. As a double major with math, I aim to apply both fields to solve complex problems in security and related areas.
