Hey! I'm **Shrikar Vasisht**, a recent grad in computer science and math from the **University of Maryland**. My interests and hobbies include cybersecurity, puzzles, reading scifi and thriller novels, and photography.

I'm currently enrolled in the Online Masters in CS program at **Georgia Tech** starting fall 2024. In my final semester at UMD, I studied abroad at the **National University of Singapore**.

During summer 2023, I interned at **Cisco**, where I was working on security engineering projects. I've also previously worked at **Leidos** and with multiple professors at UMD. I'm experienced with multiple coding languages including **Python, Java, Rust**, and **C/C++**. As a double major with math, I aim to apply both fields to solve complex problems in security and related areas.
